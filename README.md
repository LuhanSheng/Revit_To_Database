## <a name="versions"></a> Versions

The most up-to-date version provided here is for Revit 2020.


## Installation

You install RevitLookup just like any other Revit add-in,
by [copying the add-in manifest and the assembly DLL to the Revit Add-Ins folder](http://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2019/ENU/?guid=Revit_API_Revit_API_Developers_Guide_Introduction_Add_In_Integration_Add_in_Registration_html).


If you specify the full DLL pathname in the add-in manifest, it can also be located elsewhere.

For more information on installing Revit add-ins in general, please refer to
the [Revit API getting started material](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#2).
